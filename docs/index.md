# Welcome to Deep Glue
<img src="images/deep_glue_logo.png" width="150" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">

Deep Glue provides common utilities for pytorch-based deep learning projects. It's a way to keep the useful stuff together in one place to simplify workflows.  The guiding principle is ease-of-use.

Install Deep Glue with `pip install deepglue`. Import deep glue as `dg`. 

To test out deep glue on a sample project, try out the [demo notebook](https://github.com/EricThomson/deepglue/tree/main/demos).

This is pre-alpha -- a rapidly changing work in progress -- expect breaking changes. 

## Features
Currently the main features focus on:

- Train and test workflows 
- Plotting and visualization
- File wrangling

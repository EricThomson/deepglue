# Welcome to Deep Glue

deepglue provies common utilities for pytorch projects. It's a way to keep the useful stuff together in one place. There are plotting, file management, test/train functions that are present in just many different pytorch projects and I'm creating this to avoid repeating myself.

The goal is for readability and clarity of code to be the guiding value as it will maximize understanding and progress. Check out [Usage](usage.md) on how to use deepglue.

To inspect thne different functions available sese the [API page](api.md).

This is pre-beta and a WORK IN PROGRESS

## Features
- Plotting utilities
- File utilities
- Train and test workflows that are are simple and transparent

Deep Glue provides common utilities for pytorch projects. It's a way to keep the useful stuff together in one place. The main guiding value is ease-of-use.

Install Deep Glue with `pip install deepglue`. Import deep glue as `dg`. 

This is pre-alpha -- a rapidly changing WORK IN PROGRESS where things will break.

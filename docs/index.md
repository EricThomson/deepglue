# Welcome to Deep Glue
<img src="images/deep_glue_logo.png" width="150" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">

Deep Glue provides common utilities for pytorch-based deep learning projects. It's a way to keep the useful stuff together in one place. The guiding principle is ease-of-use.

Install Deep Glue with `pip install deepglue`. Import deep glue as `dg`. 

This is pre-alpha -- a rapidly changing work in progress -- expect breaking changes. 

## Features

Currently the utilities emphasize machine vision especially classification. Provides tooling for:    

- Train and test workflows 
- Plotting and visualization
- File wrangling

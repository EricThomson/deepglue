# deepglue Code of Conduct
**Note**: deepglue is currently a personal side project of one developer, but since I would like contributions and feedback (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)), I think it's important to have a CoC. 

The body of this Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant
version 2.1, available at
[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html](v2.1).

*Briefly*: if there are ever any conduct-related issues with deepglue (as discussed below in the next two sections), please feel free to reach out to me personally at thomson dot eric (google email). If you are not comfortable emailing me, you can bring up the problem in a [discussion thread](https://github.com/EricThomson/deepglue/discussions) at deepglue. I will do my best to address the problem in a fair and timely fashion, and I will respect your privacy. 

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior, and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all deepglue-related spaces, including its GitHub repository, discussions, and community interactions. It also applies when an individual is officially representing deepglue in public spaces. 

## Reporting and Enforcement Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project's core developer. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

As the project grows, and additional maintainers join, those who fail to  uphold or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by a majority of the project's core developers.

I will respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

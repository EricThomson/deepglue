Utilities for pytorch-based deep learning projects. Keeping the useful stuff together in one place.

- `pip install deepglue`
- `import deepglue as dg`
- Read the docs at https://deepglue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

Deep Glue is a rapidly-changing work in progress (pre-alpha). 

 
 ### Plans for deepglue
- Visualization of clustering of classes by layer using umap.
- Visualize features by layer.
- Add checkpoints during training 
- Simple tutorials

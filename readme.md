Utilities for pytorch-based deep learning projects. Keeping the useful stuff together in one place.

The basic philosophy of deepglue is to provide simple functionality that makes deep learning projects easier. There are lots of functions we tend to replicate across different ML projects, and deepglue puts them together in one place. The guiding principle is that the code should be readable and easy to use. 

- `pip install deepglue`
- `import deepglue as dg`
- Read the docs at https://deepglue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 
- Check out the [demo notebook](https://github.com/EricThomson/deepglue/tree/main/demos) to see deepglue in action! :rocket:
